## Possible Problem Statement
* How does the inclusion of Marsâ€™ moons (Phobos and Deimos) or even the Sun affect the motion of a satellite orbiting around Mars?
* Does the size of the orbit (and how close the satellite is to the moons) have a significant impact on the resulting motion of the satellite?
* N-body problem with the satellite, Mars, Sun(?), Phobos(?), and Deimos(?)

## Possible Numerical Methods to Explore
1. Runge-Kutta or AB3
2. Implicit methods not discussed in class?
3. Other explicit methods not discussed in class?
